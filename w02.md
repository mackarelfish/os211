suckless is a group of programmers that wrote softwares that is simple, clear, and frugal. Many of our software nowadays consist of to much bloat and unnecesary complexity which leads to bugs
and other issues. The suckless philosophy stated that software should be written in a simple, and minimal manner. Some of suckless popular software are dwm (dynamic window manager), st (simple terminal),
and dmenu (dynamic menu) which require the user to compile the source code and use the source code as 'config file'. suckless softwares push the idea that the base software is to be keep simple and other
features should be added as 'patches' which is contributed by the community.

## 8. [regex101](https://regex101.com/)
