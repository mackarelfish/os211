# Top 10 List of Week 01

## 1. [Plan 9 from Bell Labs](https://9p.io/plan9)
Plan 9 from Bell Labs is an operating system developed in the mid 80's at the 'legendary' AT&T Bell Labs by Rob Pike, Ken Thompson, Dave Presotto, and Phil Winterbottom. Plan 9 replaces Unix
as Bell Labs primary platform for OS research. Although it's discontinuation (as Bell Labs declined in the mid 2000's), there are a few forks of the OS (e.g Inferno, 9front), and also a port
of the user space applications to *nix, macOS, and Windows such as acme (editor) and others.

## 2. [ssg5: static site generator with find, grep, awk and lowdown](https://www.romanzolotarev.com/ssg.html)
Upon searching for a static site generator, I came across ssg5, a static site generator written in POSIX compliant shell with only 180 loc. Although quite basic, it is surely
enough for a simple blog post or a simple site. I forked it to my github and make some slight modification, adding script to add articles list, and in the near future add includes functionality.

## 3. [Debian](https://debian.org)
Debian is one of the oldest GNU/Linux distro, it is for the stability and lovely package manager. Although the site may need some work to make clear on where to download the ISO, other than that
Debian is still a solid disto to choose for a daily driver.

## 4. [Neovim](https://neovim.com/)
Neovim is a fork of the ViM editor, Neovim vision is to reduce and refactor ViM codebase which is huge because of the age of the codebase itself and the mission of ViM which that it needs to
keep compability for older and a wide of device. Neovim also strife to give better defaults for regular users and also new users. I have personally used Neovim for almost a year and so far it's
been a smooth experience.

## 5. [Vim: Tutorial on Customization and Configuration](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JFr28K65-5E&t=2630s)
This one hour long tutorial on vim configuration by Leeren Chang is maybe one of the best i've ever seen. I've watch his talk on 2018 on vim workflows with tmux before which talks about his
vim configuration and how to incorporate tmux to his coding workflow. This tutorial is more thorough and shows how vim default features can 'compete' with much more bigger IDE software.

## 6. [K&R The C Programming Language Book](https://www.amazon.com/Programming-Language-2nd-Brian-Kernighan/dp/0131103628)
The C Programming Language Book by Brian Kerninghan and Dennis Ritchie is a great book to learn the basics of the C programming language as teached by the co-author of the language itself (Dennis Ritchie)
and Brian Kerninghan who also worked at Bell Labs at that time. The book gives easy to understand examples and actively stimulate the reader with practice questions on each topic.

## 7. [suckless: software that suck less](https://suckless.org)
suckless is a group of programmers that wrote softwares that is simple, clear, and frugal. Many of our software nowadays consist of to much bloat and unnecesary complexity which leads to bugs
and other issues. The suckless philosophy stated that software should be written in a simple, and minimal manner. Some of suckless popular software are dwm (dynamic window manager), st (simple terminal),
and dmenu (dynamic menu) which require the user to compile the source code and use the source code as 'config file'. suckless softwares push the idea that the base software is to be keep simple and other
features should be added as 'patches' which is contributed by the community.

## 8. [regex101](https://regex101.com/)
Sometimes debugging a regex expression can be quite cumbersome, I found that a regex tester like regex101 to be very useful to visualize the selection, and other expression that I made.

## 9. [TLDP Bash Gude for Beginners](https://tldp.org/LDP/Bash-Beginners-Guide/html/)
TLDP's Bash Guide for Beginners is a thorough guide to bash programming. After searching reddit for a good guide to bash programming I got recommended this site.
The site consist 12 chapters and is seperated per sub-chapter. Each sub-chapter consist of examples and easy to understand explanation.

## 10. [A Tour of Go](https://tour.golang.org/)
Golang is a lanaguage designed at Google by Robert Griesemer, Rob Pike, and Ken Thompson. Go is said to be an alternative to C as a systems programming with a simple syntax and a garbage collector.
This link give an interactive tour on the language for first timers and hopefully make your feet wet on the Go language.
